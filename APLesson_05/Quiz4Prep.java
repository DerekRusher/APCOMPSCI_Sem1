/*Question_01*/ (wrong [needs only one line]) would get right

/*Question_02*/ (wrong [put sum instead of price]) would get right

System.out.printf("%11S .......... $%.2f", item, price);

/*Question_04*/ (right, answer was [System.out.printf("The surface area of your cube is %.5f inches. ",<--

System.out.printf("The surface area of your cube is %.5f", side*side*side);

/*Question_05*/ (right, I contest. answer was [System.out.printf("The sum of " + num1 + " and " +  num2<--
--> + " is %.2f".format(calcSum(one, two));])

double sum = one + two;
System.out.printf("The sum of  t%f and %f is %.2f", one, two, sum);

/*Question_06*/ (right, I contest. answer was [c])
